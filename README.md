# Open Book Search - Find book recommendations with the help of AI

Open Book Search is a personal project to scrape newly released books and give them context. It uses a chatgpt-3.5-turbo model trained on book summaries and reviews. This model can predict what other books are most similar, or if it is like books the user has liked in the past.
